        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>
                This is my favorite recipe for when I'm in a rush and tired.
                Basically you have and instant pot you throw in all of the ingredients
                into the instant pot then you cook on high for 12 minutes. After that
                you just depressurize the pot when its done. Then you shred the chicken
                with 2 forks and put it back into the sauce and stir. Then you get your 
                taco shells or tortillas, and whatever toppings you want and make some
                healthy and tasty tacos that took you less than 10 minutes of labor.
