            <h4>Description</h4>
            <p>
                    This is a recipe that I don't make in an instant pot. Instead it uses one 
                    pan and it really fast. This only makes one portion though so if you want
                    to cook for multiple peoplle it can be a tad time consuming. Bascially you Cook
                    onion and chicken in a sauce that you make. Then you add egg to it and so that it
                    all cooks into this delicious dish that goes on top of rice. The egg absorbs the some
                    of the sauce making it less watery and so freaking tasty.
